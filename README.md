In this read, I learnt to: 
- render components only when a certain condition is met
- use `if/else` statement in  conditional rendering
- where and how to put the conditional rendering logic
- use the `ternary operator` in conditional rendering
- adding & nesting JSX in ternary statements
- use the `&&` operator
